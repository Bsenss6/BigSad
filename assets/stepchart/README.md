The files gives information for when and where the notes need to be played.

## Column 1: Timestamps

The first column of the csv file gives information for the timestamp of each note, in seconds.

This represents the moment the note should be pressed on the keyboard,
and not the moment where the note should start to be visible on the screen.

The number indicated was synced with the mp3 file provided by Zachary.
The first sound of the mp3 is played at 0s.
The first feather (player note) appears four measures later(~7s),
assuming that the time is started to be count at 0s.

## Column 2: Keys

The second column of the csv file gives information for which note should be played.

The keys "j", "k" and "l" are to be pressed on the keyboard for a perfect score.

The key "j" should be pressed for the pig on the left,
"k" for the peacock in the middle,
and "l" for the lion on the right.
